  LA Hacks 2019 Project.
</p>

### Description

Modern social media encourages bad habits: isolation, sedentary life style.

Our app lets users pin comments, pictures, and media to specific geo-locations. Other users must go directly to the location to interact with this media.

This has great applications for guided tourism, sharing tips and information, and building a healthy social media platform that encourages physical movement.

### Purpose

The entire project was built over a period of 36 hours at UCLA's hackathon, LA Hacks 2019. This project was originally intended as a mobile application, but we were forced to migrate it to a Ruby on Rails web application as the wireless connection at the hackathon was not strong enough for us to download the Android SDK. It primarily uses the following technologies:

* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL
* Google Maps JavaScript API
